Computational analysis of the energy barrier for the Stone Wales transformation in carbon nanotubes
Goals: 
(x) Calculate the energy of a pristine carbon nanotube segment in three states: in an unaltered state, a transition state for a Stone-Wales transformation involving the rotation of two carbon atons, and the "defect" state which is also a potential minimum and corresponds to the same transformation 
(x) Calculate the energy of a carbon nanotube segment which is functionalized (by H, OH, etc.) in one location on the side wall, which changes the bond orientation on the functionalized carbon (to an sp3-like geometry) and nearby carbons
() Calculate the energy of the same tranisiton and defect states for the functionalized carbon
() Determine any dependence of the energy barrier on the location of the functionalization with respect to the Stone-Wales transformation
